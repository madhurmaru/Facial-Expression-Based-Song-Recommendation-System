# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-Based-Song-Recommendation-System

A deep learning-based application that detects facial expressions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the FER-2013 dataset, and recommends music that aligns with the detected emotion (Happy, Sad, Neutral). This project bridges affective computing and personalized media consumption.
